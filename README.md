## COWSAYS AFFIRMATIONS AUTOMAT
### Scientific Background: [Click here to get forwarded to ACM research article](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/3341525.3387372)

### Description of the Functionalities:

Based on the idea of consulting some aspects of positive psychology to ensure my good performance in the upcoming study period, I developed this little playful program based on the “cowsay” Python library and ultimately on affirmations and the findings of a study on the effects of positive psychology on the study of computer science (see link for the scientific background).

The program simulates the functioning of a snack vending machine, at the beginning you are asked to select a number between 1 and 20 - afterwards you have to pay the total price of 1.20 € or ingame 120 cents in coins. To pay the price, you are asked to enter a common European coin format (the gradations are: 1, 2, 5, 10, 20, 50, 100, 200, which corresponds to coins worth the corresponding amount of cents).

Once you have paid the price for the affirmation, the affirmation selected at the beginning is displayed in the form of an ASCII artwork - based on the “cowsay” Python library. The project was just a small coding project of mine - but I am personally fascinated by the algorithmic approach of vending machines in general and I was very proud when I had programmed my first own automat.
