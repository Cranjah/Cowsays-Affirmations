Dear User,


First of all you must be sure, that Python3 is installed properly on
your computer including the package management tool PyPi:

Visit https://www.python.org/ for instructions and further downloads;

I'm using the following libraries in my project here via imports, so
please make sure they are all installed on your system:

sys
cowsay
random

You can in case install the libraries via pip install command in your
terminal window, following this command patterns:

CMD: pip install cowsay

or for macOS:
CMD: pip3 install cowsay

The sys and random library should be preinstalled with your version
of Python3, so theoretically you don't need to pip install those.

Also make sure you download the public repository properly via GitHub
and especially make sure you download the file "project.py"!

To start the program in your terminal, please open the folder, which
contains the program, in your terminal and run this command:

CMD: python project.py

or for macOS:
CMD: python3 project.py

For each given task type in your answer directly into the terminal and
hit the enter key on your keyboard to confirm your answer.

After completing all tasks you will be given one positive affirmation.

Kindest Regards,


Marc-Michel MÃ¼nch
